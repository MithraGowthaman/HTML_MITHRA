<p>An apple is a round, edible fruit produced by an apple tree (Malus domestica).
   Apple trees are cultivated worldwide and are the most widely grown species in the genus Malus.
   The tree originated in Central Asia, where its wild ancestor, Malus sieversii, is still found.
   Apples have been grown for thousands of years in Asia and Europe and were introduced to North America by European colonists.  </p>

<p>An orange is a fruit of various citrus species in the family Rutaceae (see list of plants known as orange)
   It primarily refers to Citrus × sinensis which is also called sweet orange, to distinguish it from the related Citrus × aurantium, referred to as bitter orange.
   The sweet orange reproduces asexually (apomixis through nucellar embryony)
   Varieties of the sweet orange arise through mutations.</p>

<img src="./images/grapes.jpg" width="600" height="500">
<p>A grape is a fruit, botanically a berry, of the deciduous woody vines of the flowering plant genus Vitis.
   Grapes are a non-climacteric type of fruit, generally occurring in clusters.
   Grapes are a type of fruit that grow in clusters of 15 to 300, and can be crimson, black, dark blue, yellow, green, orange, and pink.
   "White" grapes are actually green in color, and are evolutionarily derived from the purple grape.
   Mutations in two regulatory genes of white grapes turn off production of anthocyanins, which are responsible for the color of purple grapes.</p>
